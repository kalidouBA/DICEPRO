#'@details Total RNA of 29 immune cell types (from 4 individuals) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, from 13 individuals)
#'was extracted for gene expression profiling. The 13 PBMCs samples were processed with both microarray and RNA-Seq platforms.

#'@details We performed RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling on 29 immune cell types consituting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
#'sorted from 4 Singaporean-Chinese individuals (S4 cohort). We also performed RNA-Seq and microarray transcriptome profiling of PBMCs
#'from an extended cohort of 13 individuals (S13 cohort). The data was used first to characterize the transcriptomic signatures and
#'relationships among the 29 immune cell types. Then we explored the difference in mRNA composition in terms of transcripts proportions
#'and abundance. Lastly, we performed deep deconvolution for both microarray and RNA-Seq technologies.
