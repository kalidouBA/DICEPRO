#'@details Total RNA of 29 immune cell types (from 4 individuals) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, from 13 individuals)
#'was extracted for gene expression profiling. The 13 PBMCs samples were processed with both microarray and RNA-Seq platforms.

#'@details We introduce quanTIseq, a method to quantify the tumor immune contexture, determined by the type and density of tumor-infiltrating
#'immune cells. quanTIseq is based on a novel deconvolution algorithm for RNA sequencing data that was validated with independent data sets.
#'Complementing the deconvolution output with image data from tissue slides enables in silico multiplexed immunodetection and provides an
#'efficient method for the immunophenotyping of a large number of tumor samples.
