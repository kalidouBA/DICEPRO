**Running cibersortx to deduce the fractions of the different cell
populations requires convigurations following the steps below:**

`Step 1:`

Install `Docker Desktop` :
(<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>)

Open Docker Desktop on your local computer and log in. Then, you open a
terminal, and you type the following command:
`\> docker pull cibersortx/fractions`

`Step 2:`

The next thing you need is a token that you will provide every time you
run the CIBERSORTx executables.

You can obtain the token from the CIBERSORTx website:
(<https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/getoken.php>).

Please note that each token is uniquely tied to your user account, and
tokens are good for a specific time interval from date of request, so
you will need to request a new token when an existing one has expired.

`Step 3:`

Once you have pulled the CIBERSORTx executable from Docker, and you have
obtained a token from the CIBERSORTx website, you now have access to the
CIBERSORTx Fractions executable and can run it following the
instructions below.
